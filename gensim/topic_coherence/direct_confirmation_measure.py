def log_conditional_probability(segmented_topics, accumulator, with_std=False, with_support=False):

    Calculate the log-conditional-probability measure
    which is used by coherence measures such as U_mass.
    This is defined as :math:`m_lc(S_i) = log[(P(W', W*) + e) / P(W*)]`

    Parameters
    ----------
    segmented_topics : list
        Output from the segmentation module of the segmented topics. Is a list of list of tuples.
    accumulator : :class:`~gensim.topic_coherence.text_analysis.InvertedIndexAccumulator`
        Word occurrence accumulator from probability_estimation.
    with_std : bool
        True to also include standard deviation across topic segment sets in addition to the mean coherence
        for each topic.
    with_support : bool
        True to also include support across topic segments. The support is defined as the number of pairwise
        similarity comparisons were used to compute the overall topic coherence.

    Returns
    -------
        list : of log conditional probability measure for each topic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from gensim.topic_coherence import direct_confirmation_measure,text_analysis
    >>> from collections import namedtuple
    Now we create dictionary:

    >>> token2id = {v: k for k, v in id2token.items()}
    >>> dictionary = namedtuple('Dictionary', 'token2id, id2token')(token2id, id2token)
    Then we will initialize segmented topics:
    >>> segmentation = [[(1, 2)]]
    And accumulator:
    >>> accumulator = text_analysis.InvertedIndexAccumulator({1, 2}, dictionary)
    >>> accumulator._inverted_index = {0: {2, 3, 4}, 1: {3, 5}}
    >>> accumulator._num_docs = 5
    Function call:
    >>> direct_confirmation_measure.log_conditional_probability(segmentation, accumulator)[0]
